# A circuit to charge a battery (adaptor)
AC_TO_DC converter to charge a battery from AC power supply  

  
**Task 2**  

It is best to use a 9V battery since our dc motors need that voltage. 
  
 
 
 
  
 **B. The circuit**  
 
TinkerCad could not simulate the circuit (adaptor) so I used Multisim. You can see that a sinusoidal input has convered into a dc constant voltage of 9V as our battery needs.
